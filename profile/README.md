# Business Development Kit

**BusDK** is an in-progress, modular, CLI-first toolkit for **small-business accounting and bookkeeping**, built around **open, long-lived formats** and **transparent, auditable operations**.

All business data lives in **UTF-8 CSV files** with **Frictionless Data Table Schema (JSON)** as the authoritative source of typing and constraints, intended to be maintained inside a **Git repository** for a tamper-evident history of every change. The system favors **simple primitives**, **deterministic behavior**, and workflows that work equally well for humans and automated agents.

BusDK is currently under active development (pre-release): interfaces and file conventions may still change, and not all modules are feature-complete. The goal is to ship a suite of focused subcommand binaries invoked through the core `bus` dispatcher, including: [bus-accounts](https://github.com/busdk/bus-accounts), [bus-attachments](https://github.com/busdk/bus-attachments), [bus-bank](https://github.com/busdk/bus-bank), [bus-budget](https://github.com/busdk/bus-budget), [bus-entities](https://github.com/busdk/bus-entities), [bus-invoices](https://github.com/busdk/bus-invoices), [bus-journal](https://github.com/busdk/bus-journal), [bus-period](https://github.com/busdk/bus-period), [bus-reconcile](https://github.com/busdk/bus-reconcile), [bus-reports](https://github.com/busdk/bus-reports), [bus-validate](https://github.com/busdk/bus-validate), and [bus-vat](https://github.com/busdk/bus-vat).
