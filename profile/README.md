# Business Development Kit (BusDK)

**BusDK** is a modular, Git-native, CLI-first toolkit for running a business — built on open, long-lived formats and transparent, auditable workflows, designed to work equally well for humans and AI agents.

A Bus workspace lives in a **Git repository**. Business data is stored as **UTF-8 CSV datasets** and validated with **Frictionless Table Schema (JSON)** as the authoritative source of typing, constraints, and cross-table integrity. The system focuses on **small primitives**, **deterministic behavior**, and workflows that remain inspectable and reproducible over time.

BusDK is currently **pre-release** and under active development: interfaces, schemas, and file conventions may still change, and not all modules are feature-complete. The long-term goal is a coherent suite of modules invoked through the `bus` command (see [Releases](https://github.com/busdk/busdk/releases)). Specifications and documentation live at [docs.busdk.com](https://docs.busdk.com). For deeper architectural background, see [the BuSDK design document](https://docs.busdk.com/sdd).

## Business Model

BusDK will be distributed as free, ready-to-run CLI binaries, so anyone can download and use the tools immediately. The full source code and documentation are available to subscribers: during an active subscription you get access to the latest repositories, updates, and release history. All subscriber-accessible code and documentation are provided under the MIT License, so once you have access you may use, modify, and redistribute them under MIT terms. Subscriptions fund ongoing development, maintenance, and timely updates, and provide the simplest official way to stay current with BusDK releases.
